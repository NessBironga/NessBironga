### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**NessBironga/NessBironga** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on ALX/Holberton projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on C and basic Javascript & CSS
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any of my public repositories for any improvements or corrections
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about best practices
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have watched 3 idiots more times than I care to admit.
